*NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions – Exploratory Data Analysis

- This project explores the “Motor Vehicle Collisions – Crashes” dataset from New York City, aiming to uncover patterns and trends that influence traffic safety.
- Using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib/Seaborn, the analysis identifies collision hotspots, time-based patterns, and factors contributing to severe accidents.

*Key Highlights

- Performed data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values and standardize key attributes such as location, contributing factors, and injury counts.
- Conducted descriptive and trend-based analyses to reveal high-risk boroughs, frequent accident times, and vehicle types most involved in crashes.
- Created interactive and static visualizations for improved interpretability and presentation of results.
- Generated insights to enhance predictive modeling for potential collision zones and improve data-driven decision-making in urban planning.
